# .dotfiles

[![pre-commit](https://img.shields.io/badge/pre--commit-enabled-brightgreen?logo=pre-commit)](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

Trying to get me, Windows, apps and dotfiles in order.

Mainly a way for me to learn more about PowerShell. That is why some parts are way more complicated then they should be.

## Usage

Just started, so no usage :) But hopfully some nice app and dotfiles management.

## Apps nameing logic

I have rewritten this logic to many times so i will not update this section until it is more set in stone and not set in vapor.

App name is from the name the app has in Scoop.

Should be used in:

    - App folder name (Folder in Apps)
    - App script file name (ps1 file in folder)
    - App function names (functions in ps1 file)
    - App object variable. (Variable containing the result of Create-AppObject)
