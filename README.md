Trying to get me, Windows, apps and dotfiles in order.

Mainly a way for me to learn more about PowerShell. That is why some parts are way more complicated then they should be.

## Usage

Hopfully some nice app and dotfiles management and a way to handle custom things.

## Names

- App ps1 = App Folder = Class Name = Scoop Name
  - Problem with this is that Scoop Name is a file name and there is different restrictions on files and folders. Trying to use Id as a safe alternative.

But im now thinking about setting Id to Packet Managers Name, then i just need to do a little searching for that Id. Then finding a safe name standard for App ps1 = App Folder = Class Name
